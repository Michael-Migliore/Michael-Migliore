Hi there, I'm Michael, a professional data analyst.

www.linkedin.com/in/michael-migliore

I have experience with 5 projects. My skills include business analytics, spreadsheets, SQL, Tableau, storytelling, Power BI, and basic Python. I leverage my skills to transform data into actionable insights.

I’m currently working on a project to reduce the return rate for a store with branches across the United States. For this project, I created visualizations, a dashboard, and a story using Tableau. To close it off, I delivered a presentation to the CEO communicating the key takeaways and recommendations.

I was an educator for over ten years, a position that allowed me to perfect my presentation and communication skills and helped me develop a niche for delivering complex concepts to classes that sometimes didn’t understand a word of what I was saying. How did I manage? Don’t ask!

I decided to change careers and developed a passion for data analysis and storytelling. I joined Tripleten, a tech boot camp that allows full-time employees to learn new skills while still working their jobs. This program allowed me to dive deep into data analytics and taught me the skills I need to become a successful data analyst.
